## Question 1: What is the taxonomic composition of the primary colonizing microbiota ?

### Taxonomy preprocessing

Taxonomy preprocessing aims is to create a less complicated dataframe which includes only necessary information. In addition, it computes the relative abundance. This notbook is available here : [Link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alex-merge/Holopig-data-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Taxonomic_data_preprocessing.nb.html)

### Taxonomy analysis  

This notbook contains the code required to create the graphs. It takes the preprocessed data from the previous notebook. This notbook is available here : [Link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alex-merge/Holopig-data-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Taxonomic_data_analysis.nb.html)\

## Question 2: What is the function composition of the primary colonizing microbiota ?

### Function preprocessing

Function preprocessing aims to create smaller files for an easier using during processing. This notbook is available here : [Link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alex-merge/Holopig-data-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Metabolic_functions_preprocessing.nb.html)

### Function analysis

The following notebook computes the relative abundance for each function in each individual. The type of function can be modified by the user. Data frames and two different heat maps are created (with and without unkwown name functions). This notbook is available here : [Link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alex-merge/Holopig-data-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Metabolic_functions_analysis.nb.html)

## Question 3: What are the genes that are correlated to metabolites abundance ?

### Correlation gene-metabolite analysis

Genes and metabolites correlation This notebook contains all preprocessing steps necessary for this question as well as the code generating figures. This notebook is available here : [Link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alex-merge/Holopig-data-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Genes_and_metabolites_correlation.nb.html)

## Question 4: What are the bacteria that are correlated to gene ?

### Correlation bacteria-gene analysis

This notebook is available here : [Link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alex-merge/Holopig-data-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/.nb.html)
