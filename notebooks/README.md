## Question 1: What is the taxonomic composition of the primary colonizing microbiota ?  
#### Taxonomy preprocessing  
Taxonomy preprocessing aims is to create a less complicated dataframe which includes only necessary information.
In addition, it computes the relative abundance.

#### Taxonomy analysis
This notbook contains the code required to create the graphs. It takes the preprocessed data from the previous notebook.

## Question 3: What are the genes that are correlated to metabolites abundance ?  
#### Genes and metabolites correlation
This notebook contains all preprocessing steps necessary for this question as well as the code generating figures.
