Project Holopig (INRAE, Toulouse, France)

Comparison of metabolomic and metagenomic data from piglets treated with or without Colistin (antibiotic) during their first 7-days of living.

Processing and treatment of holopig data in order to :
  1. Analyse the taxonomy abundance of the microbiota
  2. Analyse the function abundance of the microbiota
  3. Study the correlations between the bacterial abundance and the metabolite's abundance
  4. Identify bacteria expressing genes involved in metabolite production
